Localization method (file is localizationV2.py):

Arguements: the image that will be processed, x value of the location of the edge on the origional image, 
  y value of the location of the edge on the origional image, half of the angle of view from the camera that
  we are using, the height at which the plane is flying, the current location of the plane (longitude), the
  current location of the plane (latitude), current direction the plane is facing (clockwise from north)
  
Algorithm: 
  1) Change angles to radians from degrees
  2) Finds the feet per pixel
  3) Finds the distance between target and center of image in pixels, then converts to feet
  4) Tilts the axis so that distance between the targets has an angle relative to north (helps in the calculation
     of latitude and longitude of the target when split into unit vectors)
  5) Find latitude and longitude using degree latitude to feet conversion specific to NOVA/Maryland
  6) Prints out all values
  
Output:
  None, prints out position of target in latitude, longitude format. Also returns the distance between the position of
  the plane on the ground and the target in feet.
